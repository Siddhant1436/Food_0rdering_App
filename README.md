# React Hooks

-Normal JS utility function
useState()
useEffect()

//it keeps the UI in sync with the data layer.
when with the help of setList we change the list it will automatically updates the component, which doesn't happen with
normal js variables.

whenever the state variable updates the react re-renders the components(triggers the reconciliationf).
React is only good at DOM operations
